Recursion -  In a loop, state is preserved by an object declared outside the loop that is changed each iteration. 
In resursion, the resursive function itself seems to replace the action of preserving state.
Rather, it is the call stack that preserves the current state of the function, similar to an object declared outside of a loop's scope.
